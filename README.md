# Data-Wrangling

Introduction

While the broadsheet decline with the popularity of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, and even influencers on Instagram or Youtube have millions of followers, whether the mainstream media could impact on the public remains a question. Therefore, the project is to make a study on the New York Times articles of Coronavirus and the public opinion polls to have a rough idea of if there is any relation between a broadsheet and its influence on the general public.

Sentiment analysis is extracting the perception, which indicates a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, of people towards a particular issue, brand, scheme, etc., from textual data. It has a wide range of applications, from brand monitoring, product review analysis to policymaking.

For this project, the method of sentiment analysis and a simple count of newspaper coverage on the relevant topic will be implemented on the articles after using several sets of query words to retrieve search results.
